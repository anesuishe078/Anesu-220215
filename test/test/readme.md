1a)Frontend vs Backend

Frontend:
This is what users see and use on a website — like buttons, text, and pictures.
Example: A form on a website where you type your name.

Backend:
This is the hidden part that works behind the scenes. It handles things like saving data and checking passwords.
Example: When you log in, the backend checks if your password is correct.

5a) Define Mobile-First Design

Mobile-first design is a web design approach where you start designing the website for small screens like phones first, then gradually adapt it for larger screens using CSS media queries.

5c) Three Advantages of Using CSS Flexbox Over Floats

Easier alignment-Flexbox makes it simple to center, space, and align items both horizontally and vertically.

Responsive layouts-Flex items can shrink, grow, and wrap automatically to fit different screen sizes.

Cleaner code-No need for clearfix hacks or extra markup — Flexbox layouts are more straightforward and readable.

6b) Difference Between Client-Side and Server-Side Validation

Client-side validation happens in the browser before the form is sent to the server.
Server-side validation happens on the server after the form is submitted.

Why Both Are Important

Client-side validation gives quick feedback to the user.
Server-side validation protects against fake or harmful data that users might try to send by bypassing the browser.
